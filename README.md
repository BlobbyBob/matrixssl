##Overview
MatrixSSL has been continuously maintained since 2002. It is the first open source small footprint SSL stack. Until recently, releases were tracked on http://freecode.com/projects/matrixssl

MatrixSSL is an embedded SSL and TLS implementation designed for small footprint IoT devices requiring low overhead per connection. It includes client and server support through TLS 1.3, mutual authentication, session resumption, and implementations of RSA, ECC, AES, SHA1, SHA-256, ChaCha20-Poly1305 and more. The source is well documented and contains portability layers for additional operating systems, cipher suites, and cryptography providers.
