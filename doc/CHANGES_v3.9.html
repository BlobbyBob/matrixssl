<h1 id="matrixssl-3.9-changelog">MatrixSSL 3.9 changelog</h1>
<h2 id="changes-between-3.9.0-and-3.9.1">Changes between 3.9.0 and 3.9.1</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Disabled support for SHA-1 signed certificates by default. SHA-1 can no longer be considered secure for this purpose (see https://shattered.it/static/shattered.pdf). We decided to disable SHA-1 signed certificates by default to ensure that MatrixSSL customers consider the security implications before enabling them. Support for SHA-1 signed certificates can be restored by defining ENABLE_SHA1_SIGNED_CERTS in cryptoConfig.h.</p></li>
<li><p>Regenerated all test certificates. Many of the old ones had exceeded their validity period. The new test certificates have some minor changes, such as the addition of some missing basicConstraints and authorityKeyIdentifier extensions. Note that the test certificates should never be used in production, but only for initial testing during development.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug that caused a segfault when ALLOW_VERSION_1_ROOT_CERT_PARSE was enabled and the peer sent a version 1 certificate. Correct behaviour is to just produce an internal certificate validation failure in this case, as the above define only allows parsing of locally stored trusted root certificates. This bug is minor as ALLOW_VERSION_1_ROOT_CERT_PARSE is disabled by default, and rarely used by MatrixSSL customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduced new function setSocketTlsCertAuthCb for setting certificate authentication callback when using MatrixSSL via psSocket_t interface. Previously constant function name ssl_cert_auth was used for authentication callback.</p></li>
